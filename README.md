## About

This is a Chess system CLI application developed up
to [this commit](https://github.com/rogeriofrsouza/chess-system-java/commit/c6b2bb0b635ea402dd93ed7ba30fdc9ee984d2ec)
during the course [**Java COMPLETO 2023 Programa√ß√£o Orientada a Objetos +Projetos
**](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/), taught by the
professor [Nelio Alves](https://www.udemy.com/user/nelio-alves/ "Perfil do Nelio Alves na Udemy").
However, there are a lot of refactorings and improvements currently being applied, which includes:
unit tests, class design and best practices in OOP and Solid.

This project consists of a chess game, allowing two players to execute commands and movements on
their pieces to capture the opposing king and win the game.
It also supports special chess moves like: Castling, En Passant and Promotion.

It must be executed in a terminal with color support for correct color display during runtime.
Currently only supported on Linux üêß
